# Vanquish-FrontEnd
This is the front end to the web application fighting game called "The Silver Calamity" that I created at Revature. It takes the users location (user provided) and then gets the weather for that city, and changes the values of the battle damage logic, and also changes the background for the characters to fight in. (Im not an artist)


To run properly, the back end server must be up and running (see RevatureVanquishBackEnd). To launch the backend, clone the Backend repository and run it as a Spring Application. From there, then initialize the front end and you will have full CRUD functionality. 
You must create an account to login to play, or it wont load a character properly or initalize the weather API, as its based on location.
Any questions email me at hunterkelly1234@gmail.com

Thanks!
