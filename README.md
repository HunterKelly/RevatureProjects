# Vanquish-FrontEnd
This is the front end to the web application I created at Revature. To run properly, the back end server must be up and running (see RevatureVanquishBackEnd). To launch the backend, clone the Backend repository and run it as a Spring Application. From there, then initialize the front end and you will have full CRUD functionality. 
You must create an account to login to play, or it wont load a character properly or initalize the weather API, as its based on location.
Any questions email me at hunterkelly1234@gmail.com

Thanks!
